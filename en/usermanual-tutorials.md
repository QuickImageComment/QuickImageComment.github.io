# User manual / tutorials

The user manual is included as Microsoft Help File in the ZIP-file with the program. To have a look into it in advance, the latest user manual can be read here:

[User Manual](Usermanual.html)

or can be downloaded as PDF-file:

{% assign version = "4.60" %}
[User Manual Version {{ version }}](https://github.com/QuickImageComment/QuickImageComment/releases/download/v{{ version }}/QIC_User_Manual-{{ version }}.pdf)

Note: In version 4.62, only bugs have been fixed compared to 4.60 and there have been no changes to the user manual.

Tutorials are available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrTOh1TBYB2e_4rANDnN6BA).
