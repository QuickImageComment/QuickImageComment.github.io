Some meta data can be displayed as columns in Windows Explorer. They can also be changed under Properties, “Details” tab. If you edit the same file with QuickImageComment (or a comparable program), this can lead to strange effects.

This is explained in more detail on the new page "Meta data in Windows Explorer".
